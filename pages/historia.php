        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Story of Garbage</h2>
        <p class="lead">
			<p>In the beginning of time, the first men were nomads. They lived in caves, survived from hunting and fishing, dressed in skins and formed a minority population on the land. When food became scarce, they moved to another region and their garbage, left on the environment, was soon decomposed by the action of time.</p>
			<p>As people became civilized, they began to produce pieces to promote their comforts: ceramic containers, planting tools, more appropriate clothing. They also began to develop habits such as building houses, raising animals, growing food, in addition to permanently settling in one place. The production of garbage consequently increased, but it had not yet become a global problem.</p>
			<p>Naturally, this development has been accentuated over the years. The human population was increasing and, with the advent of the industrial revolution - which made possible a leap in the series production of consumer goods - the problem of generating and disposing of waste had a great boost. However, this fact did not cause any major concern: what was on the rise was development and not its consequences.</p>
			<p>However, from the second half of the 20th century onwards, a turnaround began. Humanity started to worry about the planet where it lives. But it wasn't by chance: facts like the hole in the ozone layer and the Earth's global warming awakened the world population about what was happening to the environment. In this awakening, the issue of generation and final disposal of waste was perceived but, unfortunately, it has not been faced with the necessary urgency to date.</p>
			<p>The tragic side of this story is that garbage is a curious indicator of a nation's development. The stronger the economy, the more dirt the country will produce, it is a sign that the country is growing, that people are consuming more. The problem is taking on a dangerous dimension because of the changing profile of waste. In the middle of the century, the composition of garbage was predominantly organic matter, food scraps. With the advancement of technology, materials such as plastics, styrofoam, cells, cell phone batteries and light bulbs are an increasingly constant presence in the collection. Fifty years ago, babies used cloth diapers, which were not thrown away. They ate homemade soup and drank milk kept in reusable bottles. Today, babies wear disposable diapers, drink soup from discarded jars, and drink milk packaged in tetrapak. At the end of a week of life, the garbage they produce is equivalent, in volume, to four times their size.</p>
			<p>One of the biggest problems with garbage is that most people think that just throwing the garbage in the can and the problem of dirt will be solved, but that's not quite the case, the problem starts there....</p>
